description: William Makepeace Thackeray (1811-1863) was an English novelist of the
  19th century. He was famous for his satirical works, particularly Vanity Fair (1847),
  a panoramic portrait of English society. Thackeray began as a satirist and parodist,
  with a sneaking fondness for roguish upstarts like Becky Sharp in Vanity Fair, Barry
  Lyndon in Barry Lyndon (1844) and Catherine in Catherine (1839). In his earliest
  works, writing under such pseudonyms as Charles James Yellowplush, Michael Angelo
  Titmarsh and George Savage Fitz-Boodle, he tended towards the savage in his attacks
  on high society, military.
